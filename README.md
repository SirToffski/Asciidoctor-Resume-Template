# Asciidoctor-Resume-Template
A minimalistic adoc resume template. Recommended to use with [Asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org/), though not strictly necessary.

## Structure
- cv.adoc is the resume template itself
- cv_exported.pdf is the template exported to PDF. Showcases the final look
- cv_exported.html is the template exported to HTML.

## Notes
It is not necessary to have Asciidoctor installed as a standalone application. The template works well with [VSCode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) / [VSCodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium) + [Asciidoctor plugin](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-vscode).
